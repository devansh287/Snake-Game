# Snake-Game
## Introduction
This is the classic snake game developed on Android.
## Functionality
Snake is a classic 2D mobile phone game where you control a snake that moves around on the screen eating food. 
The snake has a given constant velocity in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right) and can be "turned" using two 
buttons, each of which changes the snake's direction by 90 degrees. At any given time during the game, there is a piece of food available 
at some randomly chosen location on the screen. If the snake moves to that location and touches the food, he eats it. 
Eating a piece of food also causes the snake's tail to grow longer. 
If the snake bumps the edge of the screen or if his head bumps into some part of his ever-growing tail, he dies and the game is over.
## Disclaimer
I have not uploaded the entire app but only the kotlin code and the XML files as the folder was too large. I have used
Marty Stepp's [Stanford Android Library](https://github.com/stepp/StanfordAndroidLibrary) to build the project.
